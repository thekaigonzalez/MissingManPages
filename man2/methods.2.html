    Methods are invoked in two ways, Listed below. Including Development tips.

    <b class="sub-section-header">any disk method (traditional)</b>
        The "ANY" (Any disk) method is usually ran by simply calling "luaL_dofile(L, SYS)" on the specified file.
        No other known antics go into running the .dsi program. No trackers.

        This method is unrecommended because it doesn't give the user full control over running their .dsi file.
        It will run whatever is on the stack aimlessly without any sort of direction to go into.

        This process will not contain any errors unless it is in the .dsi file, You could try running a main function
        from the .dsi file.

    <b class="sub-section-header">the C main method (traditional)</b>
        The "C main method" is the process of loading the file into Memory and executing it as a required file, as long
        as the initial header contains a PROCESS:main function (<a href="./process-tables.2.html">see this</a>)
        after running the main function, arguments are passed as an array of strings. Depending on how the disk is handling these arguments,
        this also acts as an SDK for Sub-command-line interfaces.

    <b class="sub-section-header">embedded development (sh, zsh, bash, etc ...)</b>
        When using *.sh Files you can usually embed diskutility commands into it, and run it with one file.
        You can turn it into an alias two ways.
            * aliasing the file path (requires little permissions)
            * chmod +x to create a env
        You can take advantage of this feature using the .bashrc, .bash_profiles, etc .. for containing commands into files.
        or you can execute files separately.

        Here's a piece of code you can use.

            alias diskutility="lua /path/to/diskutility.lua"
        with this method, ensure you have an argparse.lua in your /home/ directory.
        that's the only real issue with this method, is that you need to make sure your $PATH stays updated in order to contain
        these commands without errors in bash, zsh, csh, etc ...

        The second method is to use chmod to build a executable environment.
        You can use the command, 'chmod +x diskutility.lua' after appending "#!/usr/bin/env lua" to the beginning of the file.
        Then you can do ./diskutility.lua to get full features.

        You can also Alias it to create a more convenient effect.
