<h3 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h3>

<pre>
    <b><span class="sub-section-header">the original kux</span></b>
        Kux is a set of tools, libraries, and etc ... for building complex Command Line Interfaces, similar to the <b>ncurses</b> C API.
        Kux does not contain a pre-set Terminal, you should build one by yourself. You could use other external interfaces, but it will not
        give you the control as much as DIY does.

    <b><span class="sub-section-header">what are build-essentials in kux-development?</span></b>
        Simple, essentials for building Kux-based interfaces.
        Kux is not limited to just CLIs. It can also be used for a myriad of other things such as,

        * Lua 5.4-5.3 (if supported) convenient headers
            Such as: libmemio, libhttp, etc ...
        * Easy pathways for interfacing C and C++ Without using Lua Standard library
            You can use libmemio to do allocated print, etc ...
        * many other system bridges with using Kux APIs and C++.
            Check out Craptitude, a fraction of it's code is based off of the FreeKSD Kux-Based Operation System!

    <b><span class="sub-section-header">where is Kux used?</span></b>
        In projects such as FreeKSD, Craptitude, and SCDisks, a fraction of their codebase is based off of the Kux
        Toolkit.

    <b><span class="sub-section-header">what are things to do in Kux?</span></b>
        You can do a lot of things in Kux, such as:
            * play with Kux libraries
                Creating and testing scripts using the Kux terminal (or FreeKSD, if the errors overwhelm you.)
            * test out existing commands and leave feedback
                Obviously.
            * request new commands and features to make it better.
                That's why Kux is up!
            * Try to build (or just try) different Kux flavors, and find out which one is for you
                    Error-Prone (Kux), or the ultimate UX version (FreeKSD)
