<h3 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h3>

<pre>
    C-DOS is a standard STDIN format which runs lua bytecode as a binary output.
    using handlers, and C Extension, building files and running them is simple.

    <b class="sub-section-header">c-dos philosophy</b>
        CDOS was originally a test of lua bytecode using the <em>luac</em> VM.
        CDOS is a setup of git repositories to run specified actions, using
        Lua logic.

        It takes advantage of the lua VM and runs Lua binaries to protect code and for convenience sake.
        Allowing for extensible applications and Lua Dynamic Libraries.

    <b class="sub-section-header">original appearances</b>
        CDOS originally appeared when the KBOX project was released.
        After Kai Gonzalez learned this new skill, two more projects were released,
        Craptitude & SCDisks.
