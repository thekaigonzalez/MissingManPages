    You can use this free of charge, as long as it follows the terms of the GNU AFFERO General public license.


    FreeKSD is an production ready, Modern-day Unix-Shell based application which is based off of the original <a href="../man3/kux.3.html">Kux System</a>

    Open ./KSD to get started after building.

    FreeKSD Works simultaneously with The default shell, as well as run files in a venv which prevents crashes to the default shell.

    FreeKSD Provides updates for the boot chooser, Kux Shell, and the overall entire Kux filesystem.

    FreeKSD as well as working with Kux's default shell, can also run files made by the dsh and supports many other command pallets such as coreutils.

    FreeKSD aims to provide more security compared to Kux, And prevent crashes.
